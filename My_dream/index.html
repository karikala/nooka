	<h1>Girl of my Dreams.</h1>
	
	<p>It's been so long I write a blog. Only one thing that made em to write this, even I'm having 
	a damn sever headache is that damn nooka. Many of who reading this already know who "nooka" is but the  actual
  person whom I address as nooka don't know this. Even my school principal knows about her and every time she sees me alone.
she will ask me this "nooka ko yaadh aya..". I just smile in reply.</p>

	<p>Coming in to the point. Although there are many theories about the origin of dreams, I believe
	that when a person thinks too much about a situation of happening and the same, if thought by the people 
	who involves in that situation at the same period of time, creates a dailouge in our head and it will play during 
	our sleep. Edhi meeku ardam kakapthey telugu lo chebutha vinandi. </p>

	<p><b>Pardon for mistakes in telugu, blame google.</b>
	 మనం ఒక సందర్బాన్ని తలచుకుని ఇలా జరుగుంటే బాగుణ్ణు అని అనుకుంటాం. అదే విషయాన్ని మనం తలుచున్న సందర్భంలో మనుషులు కూడా
		తలుచుకుంటే, అది కూడా ఒకే కాల పరిమితి లో. ఆ సన్నివేశాల్ని మనం నిజంగానే అనుభవించాలి అన్న ఆశ మన మెదడు మన నిద్ర లో 
		నెరవేరిస్తేయ్ అదే కల అని నా అభిప్రాయం</p>

	 <p>I don't know if it is true or not but this is what I believe and it satisfy my emotions. Ayihtey edhi antha enduku chebuthunnadu anukuntunnara.
	 Starting I told you about nooka. She is the origin of my dreams. Every day I think about her and without disappointing me she comes for sure in to my dreams.
		 But the frequency of her coming to my dreams ha

	 <p>So I'm requesting nooka to please minimize your visits.</p>

	 <p>See you in the next blog, may be I should use google blogger more often it will save my time instead of coding and uploading in to github.</p>
