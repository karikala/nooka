	<h1>Girl of my Dreams.</h1>
	
	<p>It's been so long I write a blog. Only one thing that made me to write this, even I'm having 
	a damn severe headache is that damn nooka. Many of who reading this already know who "nooka", is but the  actual
  person whom I address as nooka don't know this. Even my school-principal knows about her and every time she sees me alone.
she will ask me this "nooka ko yaadh aya..?". I just simple smile in reply.</p>

	<p>Coming in to the point. Although there are many theories about the origin of dreams, I believe
	that when a person thinks too much about a situation to happen in their real life and the same if thought by the people 
	who involved in that situation, at the same period of time creates a dailouge in our head and it will play during 
	our sleep. Edhi meeku ardam kakapthey telugu lo chebutha vinandi. </p>

	<p><b>Pardon for mistakes in telugu, blame google.</b></p
	       <div class="para">
	    <p>
	 మనం ఒక సందర్బాన్ని తలచుకుని ఇలా జరుగుంటే బాగుణ్ణు అని అనుకుంటాం. అదే విషయాన్ని మనం తలుచున్న సందర్భంలోని మనుషులు కూడా తలుచుకుంటే, 
		అది కూడా ఒకే కాల పరిమితి లో. ఆ సన్నివేశాల్ని మనం నిజంగానే అనుభవించాలి అన్న ఆశ మన మెదడు మన నిద్ర లో నెరవేరిస్తేయ్ అదే కల అని నా అభిప్రాయం</p>
		</div> <!-- end para-->

	 <p>I don't know if it is true or not but this is what I believe and it satisfies my emotions. Ayihtey edhi antha enduku chebuthunnadu anukuntunnara.
	 Starting I told you about nooka. She is the origin of my dreams. Every day I think about her and without disappointing me she comes for sure in to my dreams.
		 But the frequency of her coming to my dreams has increased exponentially. And my brain using most the bodys producing energy and sometimes my brain eatingit
		 self to keep the dreams on.</p>

	 <p>So I'm requesting nooka to please minimize your visits.</p>

	 <p>See you in the next blog, may be I should use google blogger more often it will save my time instead of coding and uploading in to github.</p>
